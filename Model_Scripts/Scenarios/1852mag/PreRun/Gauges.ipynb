    "Tidal heights information:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the article by Ray, Egbert, and Erofeeva (2005) \"A Brief Overview of Tides in the Indonesian Seas\", we should be able to use the same tide level everywhere in the Banda Sea (Buru may be the only exception).  There is only one accessible modern tidal gauge in the Banda Sea located at Ambon.  Using the last 20 years of data from this gauge allows for the reconstruction of the historical tide levels.  Relying on the Wolfram Alpha engine, we find that on November 26, 1852 the low tide occurred at 08:08, which from the record would have been shortly after the earthquake and close to the expected arrival time of the first wave at most of the observation points (Saparua & Ambon in particular).  In fact, this low tide was nearly 0.5m below normal low tide.  Also taking data from the Wolfram Alpha engine, we note that the typical gap between low and hight tide in Ambon is 1.1m, with extreme high tide of +1m above the average.  From this we will infer that the first tsunami wave arrived at something close to an extremely low tide which we will infer as -1.05m from mean sea level(-.5m for extreme low tide,a nd typical tidal variation of 0.55m from mean sea level).\n",
    "This means that in the absence of any other observational information, everything should be shifted +1m (we can't justify accounting for 5cm at this level of accuracy) to account for extreme low tide that morning.  If the observation mentioned the wave penetrating beyond flood tide levels we should shift by 2m (one additional meter to compensate for flood tide levels)."

    "Wave Height Justification: traditional indonesian homes seemed to have very steep vaulted roofs their buildings, with stilts on the bottom, it seemed the height on most was well over 10 feet. I based this assumption off of pictures of lat 19th and early 20th century homes found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Indonesia\n",
    "\n",
    "Inundation Justification: We generated data for this distribution using GIS. We chose an incline of X to be the base of the hill where Fort Belgica is situated. We then measured the distance from 20 random points on the beach to the edge of the hill and took the mean of those measurements as the mean of the distribution. However, the distances had a large variance with the closest distances being 50-100 meters and the farthest being over 400 meters. The majority of the town's shore is greater than 231 meters from shore, therefore we favored the greater distances with our skew and variance. It is also worth noting that based on a map from the 1820's, the majority of the town at the time of the event was also situated on the greater distance side of the fort. Lastly, while the fort closer to the shore, Fort Nassau, used to be called Fort Belgica, our map indicates that fort Belgica was moved to its current location before 1820 and before our event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrival Time Justification: We chose the mean to be 15 minutes to reflect the historical record. We chose a skewed distribution in order to favor arrival times that were later rather than earlier due to potential estimation error. Lastly, we chose a mild variance since it is unlikely that an arival time of greater than 30-40 minutes would be mistaken for a quarter of an hour after the event.\n"

    "Justification:  this account does not give a wave height only that there was a wave. I ruled out all waves less than 1 meter because these would not have been not noticeable, and wouldn't have been classified as a 'flood' wave.  Recall that even in Buru the expected tide was quite low, so a 'flood' wave would need to be at least 1-1.5m to be noticeable. To not have caused destruction, I think the wave would have been relatively small, so I made it skewed to the left to favor small waves. I thought the largest reasonable wave that could not have caused any damage would be around 3.0 meters (1m above 'flood' tide). So I made a distribution that tapers quickly after this.\n"
