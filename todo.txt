## GAUGE SETUP AND DOCUMENTATION ##
Current:
 - gauge_dist_1852.py sets up gauges.txt
 - Jupyter notebook documents selection of parameters

Goal:
 Jupyter notebook documents selection of parameters AND sets up input file
 Benefit: Single place to edit for both documentation and setup of MCMC runs

 Implementation
 - Copy much of functionality from gauge_dist_1852.py
 - Simplify: Function to take parameters and append them to gauges array
   - Optional parameters: Assume inputs are None if not provided.
     Only want lines in the notebook if a parameter is being used (eliminate 
     all of the lines in gauge_dist_1852.py that say, e.g. 
       inundation_mean = None 
     and
       inundation_params = [inundation_mean, inundation_std] 
     so that the notebook is as simple and readable as possible.


## DEBUG ##
 - Occasionally see this error, which kills the chain (example is 213128_dt/003):
       File "/opt/apps/Anaconda/5.2.0/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/_datasource.py", line 616, in open
         raise IOError("%s not found." % path)
     OSError: _output/fort.FG1.valuemax not found.

## OTHER IMPROVEMENTS ##
 - Switch to pandas dataframes for clarity
 - Don't save samples.npy at every iteration
 - Pull all scenario-specific stuff out of core files
 - Pull all MCMC parameters out of core files
 - Remove any files that we don't need to track from the git repo
 - Restructure directories (src, data?, plots, scripts)
 - Ability to specify initial sample: (1) Manual (2) Randomly generated from prior (Justin drafted this) (3) Pick up where another sample left off

This plus the gauge stuff plus some other implementation things that Jared might have taken pictures of on his phone, e.g. lower priority would be the pre-computation of the wave height (log-)likelihood.


## OUTPUT ##
 - Push forward: Implementation: (1) Gauge setup (2) Saving the information per sample
 - Sample information: 
   (1) samples.npy: Only samples (repeated rows when rejections)
   (2) mcmc.npy: Sample, Proposal, Wins, Prior, likelihood, and posterior probability, Acceptance ratio, accept/reject
   (3) obs.npy: Mw, Gauge max wave height, Gauge arrival time
           lower priority: velocity of wave?


## VISUALIZATION ##
 - 9x9 grid of 2d histograms
 - make_plots needs to be fixed so that it's making a full list of values range(1,nsamp) rather than filtering by samples with wins>0. The current method doesn't work well when the acceptance probability is low (CAN PROBABLY HOLD OFF ON THIS - WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF WITH CODE CHANGES)
 - Revamp and standardize existing plots (especially important if samples.npy changes)
